## Development

You will need a Github Personal Access token with `read:package` permissions. This can be obtained [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

You then need to add it as environment variable, depending on your OS and shell:

- Edit `~/.bash_profile`, or for zsh `~/.zshenv` and add the following line `export GITHUB_PACKAGES_AUTH_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"`
- Restart your shell and make sure the new variable is loaded, `echo $GITHUB_PACKAGES_AUTH_TOKEN` should print it.
- Run `yarn` at the root to install all project dependencies
- Run `yarn start:storybook` to start the component storybook  
  OR
- Create a `packages/files-ui/.env` based on `packages/files-ui/.env.example`
- Run `yarn start:files-ui` to start the development server.
